### Welcome!
My name is Adam Zucchi and I am a mobile application developer in Minneapolis, MN.  I love to learn and am all in on the Xamarin platform.  After working independently for five years I now work fulltime at a startup in Minneapolis called [Mobile Composer](https://www.mcomposer.com).  I am also a co-founder/organizer of the local Xamarin user group called [Minnesota Enterprise Mobile](https://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-Enterprise-Mobile/).

### More Information
I am married to Marit Zucchi and we have an awesome dog named Oliver.  I am also a __huge__ Green Bay Packer fan (I'm also part owner).

I love meeting and connecting with new people, so please get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamzucchi) and or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamzucchi).
