### Welcome!
My name is Adam Zucchi and I am a mobile application developer in Minneapolis, MN.  I love to learn and have been all in on Xamarin since the beginning of 2013.  I am also a co-founder/organizer of the local Xamarin user group called [Minnesota Enterprise Mobile](https://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-Enterprise-Mobile/).

I love meeting and connecting with new people, so please get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamzucchi) and or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamzucchi).
